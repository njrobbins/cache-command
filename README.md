# Cache Command 
Cache Command is a video game inspired by both the classic maze arcade game Dig Dug and tower defense games in general. In the game, you are a robot who is trying to save your Motherboard, which is being overrun by drones. You have 10 levels to do so, and each level is split into two parts. In the first part of each level, you mine as many silicon wafers as you can while fending off the flying drones, who shoot at you to slow you down, before the time runs out. Afterward, in the second part of each level, you then use your silicon wafers as a resource to build towers to defend your base from swarms of drones, which vary in strength. You can also use your wafers to upgrade various stats throughout the game. Each level gets increasingly more complex in both design and sheer number of drones. Can you save your Motherboard before its too late?
